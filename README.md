<h1> SVCHOSTSPLITTHRESHOLDINKB </h1>
In Windows, the ðŸ”¸SvcHostSplitThresholdInKBðŸ”¸ is a registry key that determines how the system groups Windows services into instances of the svchost.exe process. What is svchost.exe? This is a generic host process that runs most Windows services. 
Each service can be loaded into a separate instance of svchost.exe, making resource management and monitoring easier. This key defines the memory threshold (in kilobytes) at which Windows will separate services into different svchost.exe instances. 
If the combined memory usage of services hosted by a single svchost.exe exceeds this threshold, Windows will create a new instance to distribute the load.
By default, SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB is set to 380,000 KB (around 370 MB). This means services will be grouped into different svchost.exe processes until their combined memory usage reaches this limit.
It is recommended to set SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB to the size of your memory.

Here's How:

- Press the Win + R keys to open Run, type regedit into Run, and click/tap on OK to open Registry Editor.

- Go to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control and edit the key named SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB to match your PCs memory in KB.
